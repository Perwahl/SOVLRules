SOVL is a ruleset for playing fantasy wargames. It's played with miniatures on a table or [digitally on Steam]. 

Armies made up of humans or fantasy creatures (like Orcs or Dwarves) fight on the battlefield until one side is the bloody victor. Units of soldiers are moved around on the table and the outcome of melee combat, volleys of arrows, and destructive magic is decided with dice rolls.
