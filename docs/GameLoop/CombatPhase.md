In the **Combat Phase** units that have charged or remain in base contact from previous turns fight in deadly meelee combat. **Engagaments** are resolved one by one, casualties removed, and **Break Tests** are rolled to see if the losers stick around or turn tail and run.

## Resolve Engagements
Each pair of units in base contact is considered an **Engagement**. Sometimes more than two units are part of the same **Engagement**, due to rear or flank charges. 

## To Hit Roll

## Damage Save Roll

## Break Tests

## Fleeing Units
