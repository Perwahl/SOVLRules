In the **Combat Phase** units that have charged or remain in base contact from previous turns fight in deadly meelee combat. **Engagaments** are resolved one by one, casualties removed, and **Break Tests** are rolled to see if the losers stick around or turn tail and run.

## Resolve Engagements
Each grouping of two or more units in base contact is considered an **Engagement**.

**Engagements** are resolved one by one by taking the following steps:

1. All units in the engagement attack opponents in base contact. Attacks happen simultaneously. The attacking unit makes an **Attack Roll**, then the defending unit makes a **Damage Save** for each succesfull attack.
2. Remove casualties and calculate **Combat Score**
3. Roll **Break Tests** and move fleeing units.

## Attack Roll
Each model in the engaged flank can make an **Attack Roll**. The **Attacks** stat of the unit determines how many dice to roll.   

## Damage Save

## Combat Score
When all units in an engagement has attacked you calculate the **Combat Score** for each player. The total combat score is made up of the following:

|:-----|:-----|
|**Wounds**| One point for each wound caused. |
|**Flank Bonus**| One Point for each unit engaging in the flank. |
|**Rear Bonus**| Two points for each unit engaged in the rear.|

While adding this up you can also remove all casualties from each unit.


## Break Tests

## Fleeing Units
