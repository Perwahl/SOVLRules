In the **Charge Phase** players send their units into melee combat with the enemy. Charges are declared and resolved and units are moved into base contact.

Players take turns using Alternating Activations to declare one charge at a time, until both players pass.

## Declaring a Charge
To declare a charge pick any friendly unit that is a **Valid Charger**, then select one enemy unit that is a **Valid Target** for a charge.

A **Valid Charger** is any one of your units that has not been activated this turn, is not fleeing and has not already declared a charge. A unit that already has a charge declared against it is not a **Valid Charger**, with some excpetions (see **Counter Charging** and **Charge Priority** below).

An enemy unit is a **Valid Target** if it is within range and Line of Sight of the charger. Charge range is the same as the units movement speed and is measured from the front center of the charger to the center of the side of the target being charged. Line of Sight is a 45Â° arc from the front of the unit.
