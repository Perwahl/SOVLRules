In the **Strategic Phase** players take turns activating their units and manoeuvre them on the battlefield. A unit can perform several actions like moving, using ranged attacks, or using other abilities like spells.

## Movement
A unit can move on the battlefield in two ways; **Advancing** and **Pivoting**.

To make an **Advance**, move a unit straight forward. If it comes into contact with another unit or impassable terrain it stops. The movement cost of an **Advance** is equal to the number of inches moved. 

**Pivoting** is used to turn a unit to a new facing. To **Pivot**, rotate a unit up to 90Â° around it's center point. Each pivot has a movement cost of 25% of a units total movement.

When a unit is activated it can string togheter **Advances** and **Pivots** in any order, with a movement cost up to it's movement stat.

## Ranged Attacks
If a unit has a ranged attack available it can use it once at any point during it's activation. To use a ranged attack first select a target that is within range and LoS, then roll a **Ranged Attack Roll**. The defending player rolls a **Defense Roll** against succesful hits and removes any casualties. 

A **Ranged Attact Roll** is performed by rolling a D6 for each model in the unit making a ranged attack. Any roll of 4+ is a succesful hit with the following modifiers:

:------|:-----
**Unit Skill**| Chance to hit increases by one for each point of Skill over 3, to a maximum of 2+. It decreases by one for each point of skill under 3, to a minimum of 6+; 
**Range**| 48x72"
