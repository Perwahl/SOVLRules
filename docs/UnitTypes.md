Armies consist of units of soldiers with varying stats and abilities. A units fighting capabilities are described by it's Stat Block, Equipment and Properties.

## The Stat Block
Each unit has a list of stats that describe how good it is at various things.

|:---|:----------|
|**Skill**| A units `Skill` is a measure of the units training and general fighting ability. It is used to determine Hit Chance in combat and also for Ranged Attacks. |
|**Power**| **Power** describes a units physical strength and hitting power. It's used in combat to overcome the defenders Defense stat. |
|**Defense**| **Defense** is a combination of the units general toughness and armor. It's used to determine the units  Damage Save against incoming hits. |
|**Attacks**| A units **Attacks** stat is used to determine how many attacks each model gets to make in combat. |
|**Wounds**| The **Wounds** stat tells us how many points of damage each model in a unit can take before it is removed. |
|**Discipline**| **Discipline** is a measure of the units bravery and tendency to stick around when things look grim. It's used for Discipline tests after combat and heavy casualties. |

## Discipline and Rank Bonus
In some cases a unit might be required to make a **Discipline Test**. For example, after a unit loses a combat, or when rallying a fleeing unit. 

A discpline test is made by rolling 2d6. If the result is lower than or equal to the units **Discipline** stat, it is succesful. 

When rolling a discipline test units can add their **Rank Bonus** to their **Discipline** stat. Each rank with at least 3 models gives +1 **Rank Bonus**, including the first rank. 

## Flight Move
In some situations a unit might lose it's nerve and try to flee from the battlefield. A **Flight Move** is chaotic, instead of moving normally roll one d6 for each 4 points of base movement allowance. Move the unit that distance in a straight line, avoiding other units and terrain.

If a **Flight Move** reaches a table edge the unit flees the battlefield. It is considered destroyed for scoring purposes.
