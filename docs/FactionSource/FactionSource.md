To build an army in SOVL you first select a **Faction** to play. Each faction has a unique aesthetic and playstyle. **Dwarf Holds** are slow but resilient, the **Greenskin Tribes** are aggressive and deadly in close combat, and the Elven Conclaves are swift and elusive. You then fill up your army with commanders and warriors from that faction.

## Points
To balance the game, each entry you add to your army costs points. Before a battle, you and your opponent should agree on army size.

|:-----|:-----|
|**Warband**| 500 pts | 
|**Battalion**| 1000 pts |
|**Legion**| 1500 pts |

Some units and commanders have equipment options. If they have an associated points cost it's added to the total cost of that entry. 

The total points cost of all entries and their options must not exceed the points limit of the agreed upon army size!

## Army Sections

Each **Faction Source** list contains multiple sections with entries you can add to your army. These sections are different for each faction, but they always include **Commanders** and **Battle Line**.

There are restrictions on how many entries you can choose from each section. You can never add more than the **Maximum Entries** to your army. If a section has a **Minimum Entries** property, your army must contain at least that many entries from that section! These restrictions vary depending on army size.

## Commanders
All **Faction Source** lists have a **Commanders** section and you must select one commander to lead your army. Armies at bigger point sizes can have multiple!

Commanders are single models that act on the battlefield. They are joined by a **Retinue**. This can be a unit of infantry, cavalry, or a big mount like a chariot or dragon. Commanders are always deploye togheter with their retinue and must stay with it during the battle.

**Retinue** options are listed on the commanders entry in the **Faction Source** list. A commander must choose one option and pay the points cost for it. Retinue options do not count towards the minimum or maximum entries of any army section.

Here you can find the Source Lists for all of SOVLs factions.
