SOVL is played on a table with miniatures representing individual soldiers. Dice are used to determine the outcomes of combat, magic and many other mechanics that can occur during a game. The first step to playing a game of SOVL is usually to build and army.

## Building an Army
Start by choosing one of the factions available in SOVL. Then select a character to lead your army. A stubborn Dwarf Foreman or a savage Orc Warchief? Then fill out the rest of your points alotment with units and their equipment. SOVL can be played at different point sizes:

|:-----|:-----|
|**Warband**| 500 pts |
|**Battalion**| 1000 pts |
|**Legion**| 1500 pts |

Full details for how to build your amy can be found in the [Faction Source documents](Faction Source Lists)!
