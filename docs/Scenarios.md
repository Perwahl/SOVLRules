SOVL can be played in many different ways. A casual game with a friend, a competetive tournament or a narrative campaign spanning multiple battles. There are some standard scenarios laid out here:


## Pitched Battle
A pitched battle is the most straight forward way to play SOVL. Both armies line up and go at it. The Game ends at the end of the 7th turn, or if all of a players units is destroyed or fleeing.

## Scoring
At the end of the battle each player is awarded points for each destroyed or routed enemy unit as follows:
:------|:-----
**Destroyed or Routed Unit**| Full points cost of the unit. 
**Unit under half model count**| Half the points cost of the unit.
**Dead Commander**| Full points cost of the Commander.

The player with the most points scored wins!

## Scoring Objectives
This scenario is played the same way as a Pitched Battle with the addition of scoring objectives that players can capture on the battlefield.

At start of the game before players roll for starting sides, each player places one objective marker on the battlefield. Roll a die to determine who places first. The objective must be placed more than 10" from a table edge or another objective, and can not be placed inside a terrain feature. 

Players can use units to capture objectives by moving them into their influence. If a unit is within 5" of the center point of an objective, they can capture that objective. An objective stays captured even if the unit moves away! If both players have units within 5" of the objective the objective cannot be captured, and instead stays contested.

A unit that is currently fleeing or has the Flying special rule can not capture or contest objectives!

At the end of each turn, if a player controlls more objectives than their opponent, they gain 50 points. These points are added to their total at the end of the battle!
